        <p id="para">My Favorite hobby is writing. I love writing as I can write whenever and whatever I want to write. Writing helps in increasing vocabulary, building pronounciation and much more. I got the habbit of writing from my mother. I love writing stories especially adventurous. Writing, to me, is simply thinking through my fingers. I can even write journals, diaries, poems,letter and much more. It is my favourite past time. </p>
